Scenario: Attach a picture
    - if the user tries to attach a picture, the application is breaking and showing the message: Notes has stoped

Improvement:
    - When trying to create a note with an empty title, show a popup with the message stating that the action is not possible
    - Do not allow the user to click twice to create / save a note. In case of saving the note it is duplicated
    - Statitics is a feature that is not displaying any information. In this case it is a feature that does not add value to the user

API:
    -The API is experiencing instability. It always returns "Uh oh, something bad happened" (For popular tests I didn't use the API)
